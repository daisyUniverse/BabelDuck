A WIP DuckyScript intermediary language interpreter written in PowerShell

This is nowhere near finished - It's more meant to be a learning experment than it is meant to be a functional language

This is the first time I've tried to write anything like this and I'm basically looking at no references along the way - so it's a mess

The intention is to make an interpreted language the compiles down to basic DuckyScript that's a little easier on the eyes and feels more at home to use,
contribtuons welcome
